One paragraph explanation of the proposal.


# Background and Motivation
[Background and Motivation]: #background-and-motivation

What was done before? Why are we proposing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?


# Guide-level Explanation
[Guide-level Explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already accepted and you were teaching it to a Relojban speaker. That generally means:

- Explaining the proposal in terms of examples.
- Explaining how the proposal impacts the way Relojban users (novices or experts) speak and write the language, how they use the software tools and the other Relojban resources. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide instruction on how to migrate existing Relojban texts or code to the new approach.


# Reference-level Explanation
[Reference-level Explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

Explain any technical changes (particularly changes in the grammar specifications) in sufficient detail so that:

- It is reasonably clear how the proposal would be implemented.
- It is reasonably clear how it interacts with other features of the language.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.
